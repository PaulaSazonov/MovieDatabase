MovieDatabase

This is a Java application simulating a movie database.
Movies, actors and movie databasis are represented by classes.
All the data is read from two text files containing names of actor and movies, and movies with ratings.
The dataset and the assignment outline is part of Penn State's Software Development Fundamentals course, and some of the methods are implemented as assignment requirements.

The purpose of this project was practice object-oriented programming and the use of data structures.
